Welcome to The Rust Programming Language, an introductory book about Rust. Rust is a programming language that is focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Its design lets you create programs that have the performance and control of a low-level language, but with the powerful abstractions of a high-level language. These properties make Rust suitable for programmers who have experience in languages like C and are looking for a safer alternative, as well as those from languages like Python who are looking for ways to write code that performs better without sacrificing expressiveness.

Rust performs the majority of its safety checks and memory management decisions at compile time, so that runtime performance is not impacted. This makes it useful in a number of use cases that other languages are not good at.

This book is written for a reader who already knows how to program in at least one programming language. After reading this book, you should be comfortable writing Rust programs. We will be learning Rust through small, focused examples that build on each other to demonstrate how to use various features of Rust as well as how they work behind the scenes.
